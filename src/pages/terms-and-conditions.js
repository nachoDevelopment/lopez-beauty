        <h3>Travel Expenses</h3>
        <p>
          10 miles total travel is included per booking. For distances over 10
          miles, the travel charges are 50p per mile from my home to the venue
          and back.
          <br />
          Parking – Expenses are charged to the client.
          <br />
          Makeup Trials are carried out at my address in Exeter. If it proves
          difficult to get yourself and a bridal party here, please contact me
          to discuss and I can travel to a location that is more convenient for
          you.
          <br />
          During busy periods it might not always be possible to schedule trials
          at the weekend, particularly Saturdays. I will be able to advise you
          of my availability so getting in contact with me would be much
          appreciated.

        <h3> Payment Terms</h3>
        <p>
          To secure your wedding date in advance of your wedding day and Makeup
          Trial, a non-refundable deposit is required to confirm your wedding
          date.
          <br />
          For any dates throughout the year a deposit of £50, which will be
          deductible from the final amount, is required.
          <br />
          This is deducted from your wedding day makeup and to ideally be paid
          by bank transfer.
          <br />
          The deposit is required within 7 days to secure your booking,
          otherwise, your date will be made available to other brides. The
          Makeup trial fee is required on the Trial date. The wedding day fee is
          required at least 14 days in advance of your wedding day by bank
          transfer or cash.
          <br />
          Failure to make payment will result in cancellation of your booking.
          <br />
          Furthermore, if booking is a minimum of 3 weeks prior to your wedding
          date full payment is required to secure the day.
        </p>

        <hr className="my-8" />

        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
        <p>
          Cancellation of the booking by myself will result in a refund of 100%
          of costs paid by the client. In the unlikely event that I am unable to
          make your wedding appointment due to an emergency, unforeseen event,
          or severe illness. I will try to find you an alternative makeup artist
          whom I highly recommend. They will receive a brief and any products
          required that they might not have in their kit.
          <br />
          Cancellation of the booking by the client. Payments already made will
          not be refunded. If you need to cancel an appointment please get in
          contact with myself as soon as possible.
          <br />
          Within 28 days of the wedding date, 30% of the final balance will be
          charged.
          <br />
          If the cancellation is made within 7 days of the wedding the full
          balance will be charged.
          <br />I am happy to make adjustments to the bridal party numbers. If
          any members cancel less than 4 weeks prior to the wedding date the
          client will incur a 30% surcharge of the cost of what was quoted.
        </p>

        <h3>Client Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          It’s the client’s responsibility to make myself aware of any known
          allergies or skin sensitivities that they or their bridal party may
          have. On the rare occasion that any of the bridal parties have any
          contagious skin infections, I reserve the right to refuse treatment.
          Skin conditions should be reported by the client prior to application.
          If need be, a sample test of makeup may be performed on the skin to
          test reaction. I definitely recommend a Makeup trial for this reason.
          *The client agrees to release Makeup by Michelle Lopez, from liability
          for any skin complications due to allergic reactions.
          <br />
          All brushes, tools and makeup products are kept sanitary and are
          sanitized between every makeup application.
        </p>

        <hr className="my-8" />

        <h3>Liability</h3>
        <p>
          I will not be liable for any suppliers that I recommend. Any assisting
          makeup artists will be required to have the relevant insurance. Makeup
          by Michelle Lopez has a public liability cover and is insured by Salon
          Gold Freelancers.
        </p>

        <hr className="my-8" />

        <h3>Image Usage</h3>
        <p>
          I may photograph you at your Makeup Trial and wedding day. They will
          be used for reference on the wedding day, social media and portfolio.
          Please state if you would not like any photos taken/used for
          marketing.
        </p>

        <h3>Wedding Bookings / Covid 19 T&C’s</h3>
        <p>
          If your wedding venue has to postpone your wedding booking due to the
          virus/government orders. Once the venue offers an alternate date, I
          will be happy to move your booking to the new date (depending on
          availability) so please make sure you are in contact with myself and
          your preferred suppliers as soon as possible as we would love to fit
          in with your new dates.
          <br />
          If I am unable to make the new date I will find an alternative artist
          to assist you (depending on availability).
          <br />
          All trials carried out prior to date cancellation or postponement are
          non-refundable.
          <br />
          Outstanding payments for the wedding date will be refunded if I am
          unable to accommodate the new date (Only applicable to weddings in
          2021 + 2022).
          <br />
          Please get in touch with me as I would try to help as much as I am
          able to and find the best arrangement for you and your bridal party.
